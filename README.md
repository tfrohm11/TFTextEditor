# TFTextEditor

## User Story
### AS a developer I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Application Criteria
### Given this text editor web application, when I open my application in my editor then I should see a client server folder structure. When I run `npm run start` from the root directory then I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client. WHen I run the text editor application from my terminal then I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack. When I run my webpack plugins then I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file. When I use next-gen JavaScript in my application then I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors. When I open the text editor then I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage. When I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window then I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB. WHen i reopen the text editor after closing it then I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB. When I click on the Install button then I download my web application as an icon on my desktop. When I load my web application then I should have a registered service worker using workbox. When I register a service worker then I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
